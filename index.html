                    <p> Born in Belarus. Speak 4,5 languages. Bachelor’s in Translation and Musical Diploma. Addicted to
                        coffee
                        and Web Design. Mama of two Korat cats…
                    </p>

                    <p> These things are not the only characteristics which would describe me as a person. People say
                        that I’m a
                        problem
                        solver and I always have an answer to any question. That not always true…
                    </p>

                    <p>Sometimes I have to get out of my comfort zone and make an effort to get the job done or find the
                        solution. I believe that if you want to make an impact and you have a lot of ideas, don’t
                        procrastinate,
                        put them into action.</p>
                    <p>
                        I have a lot of hobbies as well as I fall in love with a lot of things which I could make my
                        permanent
                        job, but we only live once that’s why we have to decide what we want to become. If I could spend
                        24
                        hours doing my favorite things that would be traveling, learning languages of other
                        nationalities,
                        making professional photos in order to show them to NatGeo, creating music of any style, filming
                        documetaries and make donations from earned budget to people in need. But since it’s not 2119
                        when all
                        people are actually cyborgs and don’t sleep, I figured that I would rather learn web development
                        which
                        will allow me to do all my desired things in virtual reality.
